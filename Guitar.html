            <p>The <b>guitar</b> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fret">fretted</a> musical instrument that
                typically
                has six strings. It is held flat against the
                player's body and played by strumming or plucking the strings with the dominant hand, while
                simultaneously
                pressing selected strings against frets with the fingers of the opposite hand. A plectrum or individual
                finger
                picks may be used to strike the strings. The sound of the guitar is projected either acoustically, by
                means
                of a
                resonant chamber on the instrument, or amplified by an electronic pickup and an amplifier.</p>

            <p>The guitar is classified as a chordophone – meaning the sound is produced by a vibrating string stretched
                between
                two fixed points. Historically, a guitar was constructed from wood with its strings made of catgut.
                Steel
                guitar
                strings were introduced near the end of the nineteenth century in the United States;<sup>[1]</sup>nylon
                strings
                came in
                the 1940s.[1] The guitar's ancestors include the gittern, the vihuela, the four-course Renaissance
                guitar,
                and
                the five-course baroque guitar, all of which contributed to the
                development of the modern six-string instrument.</p>

            <h2>History</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Before the development of the electric guitar and the use of synthetic materials, a guitar was defined as
                being
                an instrument having "a long, fretted neck, flat wooden soundboard, ribs, and a flat back, most often
                with
                incurved sides."[6] The term is used to refer to a number of chordophones that were developed and used
                across
                Europe, beginning in the 12th century and, later, in the Americas.[7] A 3,300-year-old stone carving of
                a
                Hittite bard playing a stringed instrument is the oldest iconographic representation of a chordophone
                and
                clay
                plaques from Babylonia show people playing an instrument that has a strong resemblance to the guitar,
                indicating
                a possible Babylonian origin for the guitar.[6]</p>

            <h2>Types</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>Guitars can be divided into two broad categories, acoustic and electric guitars. Within each of these
                categories,
                there are also further sub-categories. For example, an electric guitar can be purchased in a six-string
                model
                (the most common model) or in seven- or twelve-string models.</p>

            <h3>Acoustic</h3>
            <p>Acoustic guitars form several notable subcategories within the acoustic guitar group: classical and
                flamenco
                guitars; steel-string guitars, which include the flat-topped, or "folk", guitar; twelve-string guitars;
                and
                the
                arched-top guitar. The acoustic guitar group also includes unamplified guitars designed to play in
                different
                registers, such as the acoustic bass guitar, which has a similar tuning to that of the electric bass
                guitar.
            </p>

            <h4>Renaissance and Baroque</h4>
            <p>Renaissance and Baroque guitars are the ancestors of the modern classical and flamenco guitar. They are
                substantially smaller, more delicate in construction, and generate less volume. The strings are paired
                in
                courses as in a modern 12-string guitar, but they only have four or five courses of strings rather than
                six
                single strings normally used now. They were more often used as rhythm instruments in ensembles than as
                solo
                instruments, and can often be seen in that role in early music performances. (Gaspar Sanz's Instrucción
                de
                Música sobre la Guitarra Española of 1674 contains his whole output for the solo guitar.)[17]
                Renaissance
                and
                Baroque guitars are easily distinguished, because the Renaissance guitar is very plain and the Baroque
                guitar is
                very ornate, with ivory or wood inlays all over the neck and body, and a paper-cutout inverted "wedding
                cake"
                inside the hole.</p>
